The governments of Somalia and Yemen approved US military support and drone strikes, justifying the geographical expansion of drone strike areas in the respective nations.<a href="#header11-2z">[7]</a> Later, though, the legitimacy of US drone strikes would become convoluted as Pakistan publicly withdrew consent and Yemen’s president was ousted by Houthi rebels.<a href="#header11-2z">[8]</a>&nbsp;<br><br>Drone strikes on Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, and Afghanistan still continued, often sidestepping international laws. However, concern over the drone program also led to President Obama tightening standards for drone strikes and instituting safeguards against civilian casualties, in effect limiting geographical expansion.<a href="#header11-2z">[9]</a><br>	<br>Although the Trump administration is only halfway through its first term at the time of this project, the shifts in its policies already have major implications for the geography of US drone warfare. In the first year of his presidency, Donald Trump expanded warzones within Yemen and Somalia by designating an increasing amount of provinces as “areas of active hostility,” allowing the US military to launch drone strikes against these regions without having to go through presidential vetting or approval.<a href="#header11-2z">[10]</a> President Trump also rolled back Obama’s restrictions on drone strike targets and protections against civilian deaths, further expanding the capacity of the drone program.<a href="#header11-2z">[11]</a></p>

                Journalism is central to the diffusion of information regarding the US drone campaign abroad, making it a key source for data and documentation. The datasets from The Bureau of Investigative Journalism use both Western and non-Western news sources in order to quantify strikes and their aftermath (deaths, injuries, etc.). Journalism is also the only documentation we have other than what the White House has publicly admitted to. <br><br>This does, however, come with some problems as there would naturally be discrepancies over what various news sources deem to be the truth. These discrepancies influence the way data is represented. For example, death and injury counts are shown as ranges rather than concrete numbers since different sources may report different figures.

However, they may also represent strikes that were undercovered by news media, making their location unknown due to a lack of attention.

As previously stated, a lack of confirmation may mean that certain strikes were undercovered or ignored by news media. In other cases, the lack of confirmation may reflect the politicization of news reporting. For example, a study on civilian tolls in Pakistan showed that the media in Taliban-controlled regions often use reports on drone strikes to propagate anti-US sentiment.<a href="#header11-2z">[13]</a> Reported figures may or may not be hyperbolized as part of political agendas. <br><br>This is not to say that there is no fault on behalf of the US; in fact, the same study criticizes the US’s lack of transparency as a key reason for why there is so much ambiguity over data reporting.<a href="#header11-2z">[14]</a> Attention should also be given to the spikes in strike confirmations, which may reflect changing political ambitions. While the drone programme under the Obama administration was known for its secrecy, President Trump has been outspoken about his intentions to accelerate the programme since his campaign.<a href="#header11-2z">[15]</a> Confirmations, then, may be an intentional means of spotlighting and projecting US hegemony.<br>

            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">In this graph we can see the difference in the number, frequency, and maximum casualties per strike by country over time. It is important to note that this graph does not include strikes that did not include specific strike locations. We discuss this and other data absences in <a href="#image1-1x">this data visualization</a>, which represents the strikes with unknown locations relative to strikes with known locations. <br><br>From September to December 2018, the Trump administration has been especially targeting Afghanistan in terms of frequency of strike and death rate per strike. Relative to the three other countries, Afghanistan has received the most casualties per strike as signaled by the 2 largest dots in that group. These largest dots represent 220 kills, which is the greatest amount of casualties for any of the strikes. This intensification of attacks might be attributed to Trump’s proclivity to political controversy and his anti-Islam stance.<a href="#header11-2z">[22]</a> The figures only support that claim as the frequency and intensity of drone strikes continues to increase dramatically within the current administration.</p>

            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">It is important to keep in mind that while Bush's and Obama's full presidential terms are represented, only the first two years of Trump's term appear in this graph. While Obama was responsible for the most civilian and children deaths overall, this graph represents his entire 8-year term. If Trump continues on his trajectory of deaths and has a 8-year term, he is projected to kill nearly double as many civilians and children total as Obama did. This can be attributed to how Obama issued the Presidential Policy Guidance, which tightened procedures for use of drone strikes including standards that targets must be “a continuing, imminent threat to Americans” and a “near certainty” that there would be no civilian casualties in 2013.<a href="#header11-2z">[23]</a> Trump, however, began to dismantle these guidelines, including the high-level vetting of proposed drone strikes, the limitation to only targeting “continuing and imminent threats,” and protections against civilian deaths in 2017.<a href="#header11-2z">[24]</a> This change and shift of prioritization between the presidents may reveal why there is still a significant number of civilian deaths during Trump’s two years in office. <br><br>At the same time, however, assessing the average accuracy of individual drone strikes reveals a different aspect of the data. The average percentage of civilians killed per strike for Bush, Obama, and Trump's terms are 0.38, 0.09, and 0.04 respectively. Since the percentage of average civilians killed per strike has reduced from 38% to 4% between Bush and Trump’s years in office, this could be an indication that either intelligence has bettered on target location or that technology has improved within the past few decades. Combining information from both graphs and the background of Trump’s approach towards civilian deaths, it seems as though a combination of Obama’s emphasis on reducing civilian deaths (bringing the percentage down from 38% to 9%) and increased intelligence and technology over the year might be attributable to this difference. <br><br>Another explanation could be the removal of Obama’s guideline that a target must be a “continuing and imminent threat.” Without this guideline, the justifications for drone strike targets are looser. This may mean that individuals who would have counted as civilians under Obama’s standards might now be considered as targets and would no longer be listed under the civilian category.<br></p>

                This graph reveals that as time progressed, strikes in the different countries fluctuated. Drone strikes in Pakistan were especially prevalent during Obama’s administration, and a focus on Afghanistan has remained since Trump took office. This may be attributable to how Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif withdrew consent to US drone strikes on Pakistan, condemning the strikes as a “violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” in 2013.<a href="#header11-2z">[25]</a> Additionally, while it may seem as though Obama has killed more total people overall, if Trump has an 8 year term, he is projected to kill nearly double as many people total  as Obama did. Thus, while Trump may be killing an increased number of targeted individuals, it is questionable about whether killing this massive number of people is ethical.

                There have been some efforts to provide condolence payments to strike victims and their parents, however the payments vary by region and do not represent a just restitution of rights. Despite no official acknowledgement of strike victims, the US military provided condolence payments to Afghanistan from 2005 to 2014. However, the monetary compensation was significantly lower compared to payments to other countries. For example, Yemeni families of two drone victims received over $155,000 while an Afghan family only received $2000. In other cases, victims and their families do not receive any compensation whatsoever.<a href="#header11-2z">[26]</a></p>

It is clear that drone technologies have impacts beyond their direct and immediate military use. Drones challenge traditional frameworks that protect against excessive and destructive uses of military intervention, suggesting a need for new and more pertinent laws to be instituted. On a sociopolitical level, drone warfare can become a catalyst for misinformation when state agendas interfere with access to data and clear reporting, allowing governments to thwart accountability for civilian deaths, manipulate human rights laws, and mislead public understanding.<div><br></div><div>For a project that claims to approach drone data with a humanistic lens, there is much left unsaid about the victims of drone warfare. A large reason for this is that drone strike data—much like drone strike deployment and politics—does not take into account human experiences or lives. In analyzing mass amounts of data, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that each dot on the graph, each unknown listing, each blip on the screen could very well represent someone’s home, friend, community, or child.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are other efforts to challenge this disconnect, including the Bureau of Investigative Journalism’s project, <a href="https://v1.thebureauinvestigates.com/namingthedead/?lang=en" target="_blank">Naming the Dead</a>, which attempts to identify the victims of drone strikes in Pakistan. Representing data that has such traumatic meaning is a difficult task, because we do not want to minimize the atrocities that have occurred, nor do we want to make a spectacle out of them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We believe, though, that analyzing and contextualizing the data is an important step towards tying our understanding of drones to our humanity. We are aware that our data is fragmented, incomplete, and has discrepancies. However, our project is also about making as much information as possible accessible to those who, because of the obscurity and politicization of drone discourse, are only now becoming exposed to the realities of its impacts. We hope that access to this information will create more public awareness and prompt the dialogues needed to achieve a better, more cognizant and more humanitarian outcome.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div></div>
